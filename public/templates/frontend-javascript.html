      What are the differences between <span class='bold'>null</span> and <span class='bold'>undefined</span>?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      <span class='bold'>undefined</span> means value of the variable is not defined. JavaScript has a global variable <span class='bold'>undefined</span> whose value is "undefined" and <span class='bold'>typeof undefined</span> is also "undefined". Remember, <span class='bold'>undefined</span> is not a constant or a keyword. <span class='bold'>undefined</span> is a type with exactly one value: <span class='bold'>undefined</span>. Assigning a new value to it does not change the value of the type <span class='bold'>undefined</span>.<br />
      <br />
      <span class='bold'>null</span> means empty or non-existent value which is used by programmers to indicate "no value". <span class='bold'>null</span> is a primitive value and you can assign <span class='bold'>null</span> to any variable. <span class='bold'>null</span> is not an object, it is a primitive value. For example, you cannot add properties to it. Sometimes people wrongly assume that it is an object, because <span class='bold'>typeof null</span> returns "object".

    <summary>
      What are the differences between == and ===?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      Simply, <span class="bold">==</span> will not check types and <span class="bold">===</span> will check whether both sides are of same type.<br />
      <br />
      So, <span class="bold">==</span> is tolerant. But under the hood it converts to its convenient type to have both in same type and then do the comparison.<br />
      <br />
      <span class="bold">===</span> compares the types and values. Hence, if both sides are not same type, answer is always false. For example, if you are comparing two strings, they must have identical character sets. For other primitives (number, boolean) must share the same value.

      What is this in JavaScript?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      At the time of execution of every function, JavaScript engine sets a property to the function called this which refer to the current execution context. this is always refer to an object and depends on how function is called. There are 7 different cases where the value of this varies.<br />
      <ol>
        <li>In the global context or inside a function this refers to the window object.</li>
        <li>Inside IIFE (immediate invoking function) if you use "use strict", value of this is undefined. To pass access window inside IIFE with "use strict", you have to pass this.</li>
        <li>While executing a function in the context of an object, the object becomes the value of this.</li>
        <li>Inside a setTimeout function, the value of this is the window object.</li>
        <li>If you use a constructor (by using new keyword) to create an object, the value of this will refer to the newly created object.</li>
        <li>You can set the value of this to any arbitrary object by passing the object as the first parameter of bind, call or apply</li>
        <li>For DOM event handler, value of this would be the element that fired the event.</li>
      </ol>

      Does JavaScript pass parameter by value or by reference?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      Primitive type (string, number, etc.) are passed by value and objects are passed by reference. If you change a property of the passed object, the change will be affected. However, you assign a new object to the passed object, the changes will not be reflected.

    <summary>
      Is there any difference between window and document?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      Yes. JavaScript has a global object and everything runs under it.<br />
      <br />
      <span class="bold">window</span> is that global object that holds global variables, global functions, location, history everything is under it. Also: setTimeout, ajax call (XMLHttpRequest), console or localStorage are part of window.<br />
      <br />
      <span class="bold">document</span> is also under window. <span class="bold">document</span> is a property of the window object. document represents the DOM and DOM is the object oriented representation of the html markup you have written. All the nodes are part of document. Hence you can use getElementById or addEventListener on document. These methods are not present in the window object.

      What is asynchronous programming and why is it important in JavaScript?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      Synchronous programming means that, barring conditionals and function calls, code is executed sequentially from top-to-bottom, blocking on long-running tasks such as network requests and disk I/O.<br />
      <br />
      Asynchronous programming means that the engine runs in an event loop. When a blocking operation is needed, the request is started, and the code keeps running without blocking for the result. When the response is ready, an interrupt is fired, which causes an event handler to be run, where the control flow continues. In this way, a single program thread can handle many concurrent operations.<br />
      <br />
      User interfaces are asynchronous by nature, and spend most of their time waiting for user input to interrupt the event loop and trigger event handlers.<br />
      <br />
      Node is asynchronous by default, meaning that the server works in much the same way, waiting in a loop for a network request, and accepting more incoming requests while the first one is being handled.<br />
      <br />
      This is important in JavaScript, because it is a very natural fit for user interface code, and very beneficial to performance on the server.
