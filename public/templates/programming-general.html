      What is SPA (Single Page Application)? Contrast SPA technology with traditional web technology?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      In the SPA technology, only a single page, which is index.HTML, is maintained although the URL keeps on changing. Unlike the traditional web technology, SPA technology is faster and easier to develop as well.<br />
      <br />
      In the conventional web technology, as soon as a client requests a webpage, the server sends the resource. However, when again the client requests for another page, the server responds again with sending the requested resource. The problem with this technology is that it requires a lot of time.

      What is the process called by which TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript code?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      It is called Transpiling. Even though TypeScript is used for writing code in Angular applications, it gets internally transpiled into equivalent JavaScript.

      What is REST?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      REST stands for <span class='bold'>RE</span>presentational <span class='bold'>S</span>tate <span class='bold'>T</span>ransfer. REST is an API (Application Programming Interface) style that works on the HTTP request. In this, the requested URL pinpoints the data that needs to be processed. Further ahead, an HTTP method then identifies the specific operation that needs to be performed on that requested data. Thus, the APIs which follows this approach are known as RESTful APIs.

      What is asynchronous programming and why is it important in JavaScript?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      Synchronous programming means that, barring conditionals and function calls, code is executed sequentially from top-to-bottom, blocking on long-running tasks such as network requests and disk I/O.<br />
      <br />
      Asynchronous programming means that the engine runs in an event loop. When a blocking operation is needed, the request is started, and the code keeps running without blocking for the result. When the response is ready, an interrupt is fired, which causes an event handler to be run, where the control flow continues. In this way, a single program thread can handle many concurrent operations.<br />
      <br />
      User interfaces are asynchronous by nature, and spend most of their time waiting for user input to interrupt the event loop and trigger event handlers.<br />
      <br />
      Node is asynchronous by default, meaning that the server works in much the same way, waiting in a loop for a network request, and accepting more incoming requests while the first one is being handled.<br />
      <br />
      This is important in JavaScript, because it is a very natural fit for user interface code, and very beneficial to performance on the server.

      What is functional programming?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      Functional programming produces programs by composing mathematical functions and avoids shared state & mutable data.<br />
      <br />
      Functional programming is an essential concept in JavaScript (one of the two pillars of JavaScript). Several common functional utilities were added to JavaScript in ES5.<br />
      <ul>
        <li>Pure functions / function purity.</li>
        <li>Avoid side-effects.</li>
        <li>Simple function composition.</li>
      </ul>

      What are two-way data binding and one-way data flow, and how are they different?
    </summary>
    <div class="answer">
      Two way data binding means that UI fields are bound to model data dynamically such that when a UI field changes, the model data changes with it and vice-versa.<br />
      <br />
      One way data flow means that the model is the single source of truth. Changes in the UI trigger messages that signal user intent to the model (or “store” in React). Only the model has the access to change the app’s state. The effect is that data always flows in a single direction, which makes it easier to understand.<br />
      <br />
      One way data flows are deterministic, whereas two-way binding can cause side-effects which are harder to follow and understand.<br />
      <br />
      React is the new canonical example of one-way data flow. AngularJS is a popular framework which uses two-way binding.
