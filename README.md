# interview-qa-application

## Details

Each **Category** has questions and answers. Detail needed:

1. Category (Major and Minor, i.e. Front-End and Angular)
2. Summary (Question)
3. Answer (can be lengthy)
4. Rating: Easy, Average, Hard

## Ideas

Need the ability to:

1. Moderate: Add, edit, and remove questions in a way that doesn't open up the database to everyone.
2. Means to create a Profile for someone being interviewed.
3. ID Questions in a wsay that the information can be passed on to another user easily.
4. Desktop Version

> Look into using JS Markdown code rather than hardcoded HTML files.
